    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><img src="../img/me.jpg" alt="picture of me with a pumpkin on my head" height="600"/> <span>My name is Genesse Miles and my pronouns are he/they. I am a junior in Art Practices with a double minor in Classics and CTD. I am taking this course because it is required for my CTD minor but I have already taken software development so I am not worried about the technical part of it. I want to learn about how to design more than code, tips about defining an effective and pretty website so I can combine it with the functionality. My favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmPZUCd89p8"> video</a> is of a pelican trying to eat a capybara. I promise it is not graphic at all. <span style="color:red">My favorite color is red!</span></span></p>
